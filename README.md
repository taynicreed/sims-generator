# sims-generator

A program to generate ideas for Sims 4 gameplay. Generate all or select categories and export your results to a txt file when you are finished. 

NOTE: This generator was created for personal use and only includes expansion packs that I own. 

Plans for future updates: 
-Enforce household limit when generating relationship/kids/pets
-Addition of all packs
-Allow user to customize which packs they would like included in the generator.
